abstract = "The problem of swinging up an inverted pendulum on a cart and controlling it around the upright position has traditionally been treated as two separate problems. This paper proposes a control strategy that is globally asymptotically stable under actuator saturation and, in addition, locally exponentially stable. The proposed methodology, which performs swing up and control simultaneously, uses elements from input–output linearization, energy control, and singular perturbation theory. Experimental results on a laboratory-scale setup are presented to illustrate the approach and its implementation."
